# Graphing and Pipeline interface

The functionality contained in this folder surrounds the implementation of a graph and pipeline execution structural form of kdb+. This functionality is intended to provide a common structural template and execution mechanism for complex code bases require ease of modification which is common within machine learning use cases.

## Functionality

Within this folder are two scripts that contains the entirity of this graph and pipeline functionality. These scripts are:

1. graph.q: This contains all functionality required for the creation, deletion and update of nodes and edges within the graph structure.
2. pipeline.q: This contains functionality for both the compilation and execution of a user generated graph.

## Requirements

- kdb+ > 3

## Installation

Place the `ml` library in `$QHOME` and load into a q instance using `ml/ml.q`

### Load

The following will load the graphing and pipeline functionality into the `.ml` namespace  
```q
q)\l ml/ml.q
q).ml.loadfile`:graph/init.q
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Graph](https://code.kx.com/q/ml/toolkit/graph/) homepage.

## Status

The graph-pipeline library is still in development. Further functionality and improvements will be made to the library on an ongoing basis.

If you have any issues, questions or suggestions, please write to ai@kx.com.
